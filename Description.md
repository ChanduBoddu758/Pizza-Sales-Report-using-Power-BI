Project Description:
The "Pizza Sales Analysis and Visualization using Power BI" project aims to leverage the capabilities of Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize pizza sales data from a hypothetical pizza chain. By creating an interactive and insightful dashboard, this project will provide key stakeholders with valuable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and operational performance.

Key Objectives:

1) Data Collection and Preparation:
Collect and consolidate pizza sales data, including transaction dates, locations, pizza types, quantities sold, prices, and customer information. Cleanse and transform the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability for analysis.

3) Sales Performance Analysis:
Use Power BI to perform in-depth analysis of pizza sales performance. Calculate metrics such as total sales revenue, average order value, and sales growth over time. Identify top-selling pizzas, popular add-ons, and best-performing locations.

Expected Deliverables:

1)How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?

2)How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?

3)How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?

4)Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?
